# Lotide Repository

The lotide is a modular collection of functions that helps with practicing and creating different types of functions using JavasScript. It is considered as a clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) Library.

This repository contains all the Lotide project files completed by [Diana](https://github.com/dialop/lotide) for the Lighthouse Labs Web Developnment Bootcamp.
