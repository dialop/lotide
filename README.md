# Lotide Repository

The lotide is a modular collection of functions that helps with practicing and creating different types of functions using JavasScript.

This repository contains all the Lotide project files completed by [Diana](https://github.com/dialop/lotide) for the Lighthouse Labs Web Developnment Bootcamp.

## Table of Contents

- [assertEqual](/assertEqual.js/)
  - In this file, assertEqual is a method used to test if two values are equal using the `==` operator.
- [head](/head.js/)
  - Using the assertEqual tetsing method, this challange added a array-handling function that will retrieve the first element from the array then refactor was executed.
- [tail](/tail.js/)
  - Using the assertEqual tetsing method, this challange added a function that will retrieve every element except the first element of the array then refactor was executed.
- [eqArrays](/eqArrays.js)
  - In this file, eqArray is used as a function that compared two arrays for a perfect match then refactor was executed.
- assertArraysEqual
  - In this file, a function that prints an appropriate message after comparing the two arrays and then refactor was executed.
- without
  - In this file, a function that takes in a source array and an itemsToRemove arrays and returns only the items from the source array that are not in the itemsToRemove array was executed.
- flatten
  - In this file, a function that takes in an array that contains elements including nested array of elements and returns a flattened version of the array was executed.
- middle
  - In this file, a function that takes in an array and returns middle most element of the array, then refactor was executed.
- countOnly
  - In this file, a function that takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items was executed.
- countLetters
  - In this file, a function that takes in a sentence and returns a count of each of the letters in the sentence was executed.
- letterPositions
  - In this file, a function that takes in a string and returns all indices of letter positions in the string was executed.
- findKeyByValue
  - In this file, a function that takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value was executed.
- [eqObjects](/assertEqual.js/)
  - In this file, a function that takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise was executed.
- [assertObjectEqual](/eqObjects.js/)
  - In this file, a function that takes in 2 objects and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise was executed.
- [map](/map.js/)
  - In this file, a function that takes in an array and a callback and returns a new array based on the results of the callback on each item in the array was executed.
- [takeUntil](/takeUntil.js/)
  - In this file, a function that takes in an array and callback and returns a slice of the array based on the criteria specified in the callback was executed.
- [findKey](/findKey.js/)
  - In this file, a function that takes in an object and callback and returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback was executed.
